# Getting Started

This folder contains scripts to import the RDF endpoint schemata retrieval results produced by [OBIS-SchemaExtractor](https://github.com/LUMII-Syslab/OBIS-SchemaExtractor).

## Steps before the first import

- Set up your DSS according the instructions [here](../db-templates/).

- Obtain a JSON file containing the shape info extracted from the endpoint (see [OBIS-SchemaExtractor](https://github.com/LUMII-Syslab/OBIS-SchemaExtractor)).

- Choose the name (alias) to be used for the endpoint schema inside the DSS (it must be unique).
  
## Requirements for the import script

- Ensure that `node.js` is installed in version ≥ 16,
- Obtain the database connection information for the DSS database,
- To install the packages required by the import script, run from the command line:

```
npm install
```

## Import of the endpoint data

### Automatic and manual modes for the import script

The import script can be used in two modes:

- automatic mode, where the script handles both the database configuration and the import from the JSON file, and
- manual mode, where the script will handle only the import from JSON, and the user is responsible for providing a recipient DB schema.

### The import configuration file 

In both modes, the import options have to be provided via an `env` file.

Create an environment file (copy `sample.env` to `.env`) and configure the following variables inside the `.env` file:

  - `INPUT_FILE` – name of the JSON file with the extracted information (see previous section).
  - `DB_URL` – connection string to the Data Shape Server PostgreSQL database,
  - `DB_SCHEMA` – name of the db schema (e.g., `myendpoint`) where the shapes should be imported into
  - `SCHEMA_DISPLAY_NAME` – schema name for the UI (appears in a dropdown list of available schemas)
  - `SPARQL_URL` – URL for the SPARQL requests to the endpoint
  - `SCHEMA_KIND` – kind of the schema (dbpedia, wikidata, europeana, ...)
  - `NAMED_GRAPH` – named graph (optional)
  - `PUBLIC_URL` – public web site for the endpoint (optional)
  - 
  - `REGISTRY_SCHEMA` – name of the DB schema which stores the schemate registry (optional, defaults to `public`)
  - `OVERRIDE_DB_SCHEMA` – should the importer replace existing db schema (if exists) (optional, defaults to `false`)

By default the import script will look for the environment file named `.env`. 

It is also possible to use a named `env` file (e.g., `myendpoint.env`), providing its name as the environment variable `ENV_NAME` (e.g., `ENV_NAME=myendpoint npm run auto`).

### Starting the import in automatic mode

To start the import in automatic mode, enter the following command:

```
npm run auto
```

### Importing in the manual mode

Before importing in the manual mode, ensure that the recipient schema contains a clone of the schema `empty`. 

For example, assuming that the name of your DSS database is `dss`, and that the name for your schema is `myendpoint`, issue the following commands:

```
psql dss < empty_template.pgsql
psql -c "alter schema empty rename to myendpoint" dss
```

When the recipient schema is created, you can run the import script 

```
npm run manual
```


## Meta-parameters for environment tuning

The schema import shall set the basic options for meta-parameters in the schema `public`, tables `endpoints`, `schemata`, `schemata_to_endpoints` and `tree_profiles` (the `display_name` field in `schemata_to_endpoints` table allows to locate the information related to the performed import).

To repeat import of a schema with the same display name, change the value of the already existing display name, or delete previous row of `schemata_to_endpoints`, as well as the matching rows in tables `endpoints` and `schemata`.

## Namespace table prepopulation and tuning

If desired, the namespaces table `ns` can also be prepopulated before the import (there is a default pre-population done by the empty schema creation script).

For any prefixes encountered in input JSON, an existing `ns` entry will be used, if possible.

For missing `ns` entries, the prefix.cc API will be queried to get the short form of the prefix.

Still unknown prefixes will get autogenerated short forms like `auto_42`.

The namespaces table can be edited manually after the import. Change the prefixes to the ones you would like to see in the user interface. 

Setting a default namespace would simplify its entity appearance. 

Setting priorities to namespaces will order the entities in code completion lists.
